# TicTacToe-NeuralNet made in processing
It currently doesn't work as I'm inept at making neural nets.

If you want to help me get it working the problem I'm currently having is that they will try to go where a piece already is and I'm not sure how to teach them that they can't do that.

Should also say that I based a lot of this off of Code Bullet's DinoGame found here https://github.com/Code-Bullet/Google-Chrome-Dino-Game-AI/tree/master/DinoGame
